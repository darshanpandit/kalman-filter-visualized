PART 1: Kalman Filters
SCENE 03: Gaussian Multiplication — "Combining two beliefs"

DATA:
  source: none (synthetic parameters)
  prediction: mu=2.0, var=1.5
  measurement: mu=4.0, var=0.8
  product: computed via gaussian_product_1d

= BEAT 1: The prediction =

TITLE: "Multiplying Two Gaussians" (top)
SHOW: axes (x_range=[-1,7], y_range=[0,0.6])
SHOW: red Gaussian curve at mu=2.0, var=1.5 ($COLOR_PREDICTION) with label "Prediction"

> Let's start simple: one dimension. This red curve is
> our prediction — we think the pedestrian is around
> position 2, with some uncertainty.

= BEAT 2: The measurement arrives =

SHOW: blue Gaussian curve at mu=4.0, var=0.8 ($COLOR_MEASUREMENT) with label "Measurement"

> Now a measurement arrives in blue, saying the position
> is closer to 4. Two sources of information disagreeing —
> how do we combine them?

= BEAT 3: The product formula =

ANIMATE: shrink axes to left side (scale 0.65)
FADEOUT: curve labels
SHOW: mean formula on right side
SHOW: variance formula below it

> When you multiply two Gaussians, you get another
> Gaussian. The new mean is a weighted average, and
> the new variance comes from this elegant formula.

= BEAT 4: The golden result =

SHOW: gold product Gaussian ($COLOR_POSTERIOR)
TEXT: "Always narrower than either input!" ($COLOR_POSTERIOR)

> Here's the result in gold. Notice something crucial:
> the product is always narrower than either input.
> Combining information reduces uncertainty — this is
> the core principle of the Kalman Filter.

= BEAT 5: The Kalman gain =

FADEOUT: narrower insight
SHOW: Kalman gain equation: K = sigma1^2 / (sigma1^2 + sigma2^2) ($COLOR_HIGHLIGHT)
TEXT: "Kalman Gain" label
SHOW: rewritten update: mu_new = mu_1 + K * (mu_2 - mu_1)

> We can rewrite this using the Kalman gain K. It's a
> blending weight: K equals zero means trust the
> prediction completely, K equals one means trust the
> measurement. The filter automatically tunes this balance.

= BEAT 6: K interpretation =

SHOW: interpretation panel
  - "K=0 → trust prediction" ($COLOR_PREDICTION)
  - "K=1 → trust measurement" ($COLOR_MEASUREMENT)

> K equals zero means we trust the prediction. K equals
> one means we trust the measurement. In between, K
> automatically balances based on the uncertainties.
