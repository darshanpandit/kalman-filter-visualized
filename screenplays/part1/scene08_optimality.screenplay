PART 1: Kalman Filters
SCENE 08: Optimality & Teaser — "Why nothing beats it"

DATA:
  source: none (theoretical scene)

= BEAT 1: The claim =

TITLE: "Why the Kalman Filter is Optimal" (top)
SHOW: theorem block ($COLOR_HIGHLIGHT heading):
  "Among all linear estimators, the Kalman Filter
   minimizes the mean squared estimation error."

> The Kalman Filter isn't just good — it's provably
> optimal. Among all linear estimators, it minimizes
> the mean squared error.

= BEAT 2: The objective =

SHOW: objective function equation ($COLOR_EQUATION):
  min E[ (x - x_hat)^T (x - x_hat) ]

> We want to minimize the expected squared difference
> between the true state and our estimate — the trace
> of the error covariance.

PAUSE: medium

= BEAT 3: Proof sketch =

TEXT: "Proof sketch:" (below objective)
SHOW: three proof steps (sequentially):
  1. "Set d/dK tr(P_k) = 0"
  2. "Solve for K that minimizes tr(P_k)"
  3. "=> K = P^- H^T (H P^- H^T + R)^{-1}" ($COLOR_HIGHLIGHT)

> The proof is elegant: take the derivative of the error
> covariance with respect to K, set it to zero, and
> solve. You get exactly the Kalman gain formula.

PAUSE: long

= BEAT 4: Conditions =

SHOW: conditions block (bottom):
  "This holds when:"
  - "System is linear (F, H are matrices)"
  - "Noise is Gaussian (w_k, v_k ~ N)"

> But this optimality requires two conditions: linear
> dynamics and Gaussian noise. When both hold, no
> estimator can beat the Kalman Filter.

TEXT: "But what if the system isn't linear?" (center, $COLOR_HIGHLIGHT)
TEXT: "Next: The Extended Kalman Filter" (below, smaller)

> But what if the system isn't linear? What if the
> pedestrian turns corners or the sensor model involves
> trigonometry? That's where the Extended Kalman Filter
> comes in. See you in Part 2.
